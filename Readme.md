# Reddit Scraping

This activity is to demonstrate web scraping using Beautiful Soup HTML parser. In this school project a Programmer-Humor.html file was provided.

The aim of this was to scrape only threads that have two or more comments, then print the thread's title, number of comments, and the URL to the thread.
